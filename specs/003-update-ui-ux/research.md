# Research: Update UI/UX and Add Tech Stack Tab

**Feature**: 003-update-ui-ux  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This research phase focused on determining the optimal approach for adding a dedicated "Tech Stack" tab to the website dashboard while maintaining the clean, uncluttered design of the main dashboard.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Component Baseline
**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation for all new UI elements.

**Rationale**: 
- Maintains consistency with existing dashboard design
- Provides accessible, responsive components out of the box
- Supports both light and dark themes
- Follows WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom components (rejected for consistency)
- Other UI libraries (rejected for integration complexity)

### 2. UI Patterns
**Decision**: Implement card-based layout for tech stack information display.

**Rationale**:
- Cards provide clear visual separation between different tech stack categories
- Consistent with existing dashboard card patterns
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- Easy to scan and understand

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Table layout (rejected for mobile responsiveness)
- List layout (rejected for visual hierarchy)

### 3. Navigation Structure
**Decision**: Add "Tech Stack" as a third tab alongside "Dashboard" and "About".

**Rationale**:
- Maintains simple, intuitive navigation
- Preserves existing functionality
- Clear separation of concerns
- Follows common dashboard patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Sub-navigation (rejected for complexity)
- Modal overlay (rejected for accessibility)

### 4. Data Architecture
**Decision**: Use JSON-based static data with TypeScript models.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing data structure
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Easy to maintain and update
- No additional database complexity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database storage (rejected for over-engineering)
- API-based dynamic data (rejected for performance)

### 5. Performance Considerations
**Decision**: Maintain <2s load time and Lighthouse 90+ scores.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing dashboard performance
- Critical for user experience
- Required by constitutional principles

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Static generation where possible
- Optimized images and assets
- Minimal JavaScript for interactivity

### 6. Accessibility Requirements
**Decision**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

**Rationale**:
- Legal and ethical requirement
- Improves usability for all users
- Required by constitutional principles

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper color contrast ratios

### 7. Mobile Responsiveness
**Decision**: Ensure seamless experience across all device sizes.

**Rationale**:
- Critical for modern web applications
- Required by constitutional principles
- Improves user accessibility

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Mobile-first design approach
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for various screen sizes

## Technical Integration

### Playwright Integration
**Decision**: Leverage existing Playwright setup for enhanced screenshot generation.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing asset generation
- Provides high-quality visual assets
- Automated and reliable

### Design System Integration
**Decision**: Extend existing shadcn/ui component library.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains design consistency
- Reduces development time
- Ensures accessibility compliance

## Open Questions Resolved

### Q: How should tech stack information be organized?
**A**: By website - each website shows its complete tech stack in a dedicated card.

### Q: What specific technical information should be displayed?
**A**: Frontend frameworks, backend technologies, database systems, deployment platforms, AI/ML tools, and other technologies.

### Q: Should the tech stack tab show real-time information or static data?
**A**: Static data - pre-defined technical information that is manually updated.

### Q: What performance targets should the tech stack page meet?
**A**: Page load < 2 seconds, same as main dashboard.

### Q: How should the system handle missing or incomplete tech stack data?
**A**: Show "Information not available" placeholder with option to add data.

## Research Validation

All research decisions have been validated against:
- ✅ Constitutional principles
- ✅ Existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Performance requirements
- ✅ Accessibility standards
- ✅ User experience goals

## Next Steps

The research phase is complete. All technical decisions have been made and documented. The next phase is design and contracts, which will create the detailed implementation specifications.
