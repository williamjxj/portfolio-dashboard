# Feature Specification: Update UI/UX and Add Tech Stack Tab

**Feature Branch**: `003-update-ui-ux`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "update ui/ux, move all tech-stack info into a new tab besides '/dashboard' and '/about'"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be verifiable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site owner, I want to access a dedicated tech stack information tab alongside my dashboard and about pages so that I can view technical details about my projects without cluttering the main dashboard interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the main dashboard, **When** they navigate to the tech stack tab, **Then** they see a dedicated page with all technical information about the websites.
2. **Given** the user is on any page, **When** they access the navigation, **Then** they see three main tabs: Dashboard, Tech Stack, and About.
3. **Given** the user is on the tech stack page, **When** they view the content, **Then** they see organized technical details for each website including frameworks, libraries, and deployment information.
4. **Given** the user wants to return to the main dashboard, **When** they click the Dashboard tab, **Then** they are taken back to the clean website listing view.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tech stack information is missing for a website? ‚Üí Show "Information not available" placeholder with option to add data.
- How does the system handle navigation between tabs? ‚Üí Maintain consistent navigation state and active tab highlighting.
- What if the tech stack page takes time to load? ‚Üí Show loading indicator while fetching technical details.
- What if a website has partial tech stack information? ‚Üí Display available information with placeholders for missing categories.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a new navigation tab labeled "Tech Stack" alongside existing Dashboard and About tabs.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a dedicated tech stack page accessible via the new tab.
- **FR-003**: System MUST show technical information for each website including frontend frameworks, backend technologies, database systems, deployment platforms, AI/ML tools, and other technologies.
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain consistent navigation across all three tabs (Dashboard, Tech Stack, About).
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the clean, uncluttered design of the main dashboard by moving technical details to the dedicated tab.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where technical information is not available for a website by showing "Information not available" placeholder with option to add data.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear navigation between tabs with active state indication.
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain the existing functionality of the Dashboard and About pages.

*Ambiguities*
- None remaining

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Tech stack page MUST load in under 2 seconds, consistent with main dashboard performance targets.
- **NFR-002**: Tech stack page MUST maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all technical information display.
- **NFR-003**: Tech stack page MUST be responsive and work seamlessly across all device sizes.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TechStackInfo**: technical details for each website including frameworks, libraries, deployment platform, version information
- **NavigationTab**: represents the three main navigation sections (Dashboard, Tech Stack, About)
- **WebsiteTechDetails**: relationship between websites and their technical specifications

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What specific technical information should be displayed in the tech stack tab? ‚Üí A: Frontend frameworks, backend technologies, database systems, deployment platforms, AI/ML tools, and other technologies
- Q: How should the tech stack information be organized? ‚Üí A: By website - each website shows its complete tech stack in a dedicated card
- Q: Should the tech stack tab show real-time information or static data? ‚Üí A: Static data - pre-defined technical information that is manually updated
- Q: What performance targets should the tech stack page meet? ‚Üí A: Page load < 2 seconds, same as main dashboard
- Q: How should the system handle missing or incomplete tech stack data? ‚Üí A: Show "Information not available" placeholder with option to add data
