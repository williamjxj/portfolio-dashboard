# Feature Specification: Website Dashboard Management App

**Feature Branch**: `002-this-website-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "this website dashboard management app should implement/improve: 1) list all specified websites, 2) use details in website-analysis-report.md and README.md, general-purpose dashboard entry, use ref-mcp as reference"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a site owner, I want a centralized dashboard listing my websites with key details, logos, screenshots, and quick links so that I can quickly review, compare, and navigate to each site.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the dashboard loads, **When** I view the list, **Then** I see all eight websites with title, URL, logo, screenshot preview, and a brief description sourced from `website-analysis-report.md` and `README.md`.
2. **Given** the dashboard list, **When** I click a website card, **Then** I am taken to a detail view that shows the full description, logo, favicon reference, and a larger screenshot preview.
3. **Given** the dashboard list, **When** I use basic filtering (e.g., by tag or text), **Then** only matching websites remain visible.
4. **Given** the dashboard list, **When** an asset reference is missing, **Then** the dashboard shows a graceful placeholder with an explanation and does not break layout.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a URL becomes unreachable? ‚Üí Show status as "Unavailable" with retry.
- How does system handle missing or malformed image data? ‚Üí Fallback placeholders and error badges.
- What if descriptions exceed recommended length? ‚Üí Truncate with "Read more" on detail view.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of exactly eight specified websites with title and URL.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display for each website a concise description derived from `website-analysis-report.md` and/or `README.md`, with `website-analysis-report.md` taking precedence in case of conflicts.
- **FR-003**: System MUST show a logo and favicon reference for each website when available; otherwise use a placeholder.
- **FR-004**: System MUST show a screenshot preview for each website when available; otherwise use a placeholder.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to navigate to a website detail view containing the full description and larger preview.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide simple text search/filter across website name and description.
- **FR-006a**: System MUST support filtering by technology-based tags (React, Next.js, AI, etc.).
- **FR-007**: System MUST visibly indicate when asset references (logo/screenshot/favicon) are missing or invalid.
- **FR-008**: System MUST list and link the following websites: 
  - `https://face-fusion-agent.vercel.app/face-fusion`
  - `https://nextjs-supabase-kappa-nine.vercel.app/`
  - `https://manus-ai-shop.vercel.app/`
  - `https://bidmaster-hub.vercel.app/`
  - `https://nextjs-mcp-template.vercel.app/`
  - `https://friendshipdaycare.vercel.app/`
  - `https://bestitconsulting.vercel.app/`
  - `https://bestitconsultants.vercel.app/`
- **FR-009**: System MUST reflect content truthfully from the referenced docs; if conflicts arise, the dashboard MUST flag the discrepancy for resolution.
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD provide quick external links to each site and open in a new tab.
- **FR-011**: System SHOULD include a reference link to MCP (Model Context Protocol) documentation for future integrations.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST load the dashboard in under 2 seconds.
- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle exactly 8 websites as specified.
- **NFR-003**: System is designed for single-user access (no concurrent user requirements).
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide alt text for all images (logos, screenshots, favicons).
- **NFR-005**: System MUST support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.

*Ambiguities*
- **FR-013**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Whether to support manual inline editing vs read-only display]

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Website**: name, url, description, logoUrl, faviconUrl, screenshotUrl, tags[]
- **Asset**: type (logo|favicon|screenshot), path/url, status

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What are the expected performance targets for the dashboard? ‚Üí A: Load in <2 seconds, handle 8 websites, no concurrent users
- Q: What accessibility standards should the dashboard meet? ‚Üí A: Basic accessibility (alt text for images, keyboard navigation)
- Q: What is the specific scope and link for the "ref-mcp reference"? ‚Üí A: Link to MCP (Model Context Protocol) documentation for future integrations
- Q: What tagging taxonomy should be used for website filtering? ‚Üí A: Technology-based tags (React, Next.js, AI, etc.)
- Q: If `website-analysis-report.md` and `README.md` contain conflicting information, which should take precedence? ‚Üí A: `website-analysis-report.md` takes precedence
