# Feature Specification: Website Iteration Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: 2025-01-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a modern website to iterate 8 sites: list the screenshot image, site description, site logo, side favicon. The sites url can be found in @README.md . for screenshot, don't use login/signin/signup page directly, instead please use playwright mcp to login, then capture the dashboard/landing page as screenshot. the sample login signature/credentials are showed in signin page."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If not found: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website administrator, I want to view a dashboard that displays all 8 websites with their screenshots, descriptions, logos, and favicons so that I can easily manage and iterate on multiple web properties from a single interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the dashboard is loaded, **When** I view the website list, **Then** I see all 8 websites with their screenshots, descriptions, logos, and favicons displayed
2. **Given** a website requires authentication, **When** I access the screenshot, **Then** the system automatically logs in using provided credentials and captures the authenticated dashboard/landing page
3. **Given** I want to update a website's information, **When** I modify the description or logo, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected in the dashboard
4. **Given** I want to view a specific website, **When** I click on a website entry, **Then** I am taken to the actual website in a new tab

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a website is down or unreachable?
- How does the system handle websites that don't have login credentials?
- What happens when screenshot generation fails?
- How does the system handle websites with different authentication methods?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all 8 websites from the README.md list with their associated metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate high-resolution screenshots for each website, suitable for HTML embedding
- **FR-003**: System MUST create custom vector-style logos for each website reflecting their domain and brand identity
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate 16x16 or 32x32 favicons for each website based on their branding
- **FR-005**: System MUST write concise 2-3 sentence descriptions for each website explaining purpose, target audience, and notable features
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle authentication for websites that require login by using provided credentials from signin pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture authenticated dashboard/landing pages instead of login/signin/signup pages
- **FR-008**: System MUST format all assets according to the specified template format for HTML embedding
- **FR-009**: System MUST stop processing and ask user for further action when authentication fails or credentials are invalid
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle OAuth and other authentication methods by attempting standard login flows first, then falling back to manual credential input if needed

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Website**: Represents each of the 8 websites with URL, screenshot, description, logo, and favicon
- **Authentication Credentials**: Stores login information for websites that require authentication
- **Asset Metadata**: Contains information about generated assets (screenshots, logos, favicons) including file paths and formats
