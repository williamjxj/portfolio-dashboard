# Research: Website Iteration Dashboard

## Technology Decisions

### Next.js Static Site Generation
**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 with static export configuration
**Rationale**: 
- Meets constitution requirements for static-first architecture
- Built-in performance optimizations (image optimization, code splitting)
- Excellent TypeScript support and developer experience
- Easy deployment to static hosting platforms
- SEO-friendly with static generation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS: Would require manual build optimization
- Gatsby: More complex for simple static site
- Astro: Good but less React ecosystem support

### Playwright for Screenshot Automation
**Decision**: Use Playwright for automated screenshot capture and authentication
**Rationale**:
- Cross-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Built-in authentication handling
- High-quality screenshot generation
- Programmatic control for complex login flows
- Headless operation for CI/CD

**Alternatives considered**:
- Puppeteer: Chrome-only, less authentication features
- Selenium: More complex setup, slower execution
- Manual screenshots: Not scalable for 8 websites

### Tailwind CSS for Styling
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for responsive, mobile-first design
**Rationale**:
- Mobile-first responsive design out of the box
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Built-in accessibility features
- Excellent performance with purging
- Consistent design system

**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled Components: Runtime CSS-in-JS overhead
- CSS Modules: More manual responsive work
- Bootstrap: Less customization flexibility

### Asset Generation Strategy
**Decision**: Generate all assets (screenshots, logos, favicons) at build time
**Rationale**:
- Meets static-first architecture requirements
- No runtime dependencies for asset generation
- Better performance and reliability
- Version control for all generated assets

**Alternatives considered**:
- Runtime generation: Violates static-first principle
- External services: Adds dependencies and costs

## Authentication Handling Research

### Standard Login Flows
**Decision**: Support email/password, OAuth, and SSO authentication
**Rationale**:
- Covers most common authentication methods
- Playwright supports all major auth flows
- Fallback to manual credential input when needed

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Stop processing and ask user for guidance on auth failures
**Rationale**:
- Prevents silent failures
- Allows for manual intervention
- Maintains data integrity
- User control over sensitive operations

## Performance Optimization Research

### Image Optimization
**Decision**: Use Next.js Image component with WebP/AVIF formats
**Rationale**:
- Automatic format selection based on browser support
- Lazy loading and responsive images
- Built-in optimization pipeline
- Meets Core Web Vitals requirements

### Asset Compression
**Decision**: Use Next.js built-in compression with Brotli/Gzip
**Rationale**:
- Automatic compression configuration
- CDN-friendly asset delivery
- Meets performance standards (<2s load time)

## Accessibility Research

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
**Decision**: Implement semantic HTML with React components
**Rationale**:
- React provides accessible component patterns
- Tailwind CSS includes accessibility utilities
- Screen reader compatibility built-in
- Keyboard navigation support

### Mobile-First Design
**Decision**: Use Tailwind's mobile-first responsive utilities
**Rationale**:
- Touch-friendly 44px minimum targets
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Consistent across all devices
- Meets constitution requirements

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
**Decision**: Deploy to Vercel for optimal Next.js performance
**Rationale**:
- Zero-config deployment for Next.js
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS and compression
- Lighthouse CI integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Netlify: Good but less Next.js optimization
- GitHub Pages: More manual configuration
- AWS S3: Requires more setup

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
**Decision**: Use Jest + Playwright Test + Lighthouse CI
**Rationale**:
- Jest for unit testing React components
- Playwright Test for E2E screenshot automation
- Lighthouse CI for performance regression testing
- Meets constitution quality gates

### Responsive Testing
**Decision**: Test across multiple viewport sizes
**Rationale**:
- Ensures mobile-first design compliance
- Catches responsive layout issues
- Meets constitution mobile requirements
