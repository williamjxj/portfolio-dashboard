## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: View Website Dashboard
**Given** the dashboard is loaded  
**When** I visit the homepage  
**Then** I see all 8 websites displayed with:
- High-resolution screenshots
- 2-3 sentence descriptions
- Custom logos
- Favicons
- Clickable links to original websites

### Scenario 2: Handle Authentication
**Given** a website requires login  
**When** the system attempts to generate a screenshot

- Falls back to manual credential input if needed
- Asks user for guidance on authentication failures

**When** I view the website list  
**Then** I see:
- Responsive grid layout
- Touch-friendly interactions (44px minimum)
