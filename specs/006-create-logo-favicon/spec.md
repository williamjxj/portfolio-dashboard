# Feature Specification: Media Assets for Each Managed Site (Logos, Favicons, Videos/Images)

**Feature Branch**: `006-create-logo-favicon`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create logo, favicon, related video/images for dashboard managed each site."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be verifiable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What is the primary source of truth for logos/favicons/previews? ‚Üí A: Hybrid: manual preferred, automated fallback if missing
- Q: Preferred asset formats and sizes? ‚Üí A: Logo SVG; Favicon ICO+PNG; Images WebP; Video MP4
- Q: How many previews per site and how often to refresh? ‚Üí A: 1 image; refresh on demand only
 - Q: Any licensing/compliance constraints for generated media? ‚Üí A: Internal use only; no external redistribution
- Q: Asset retention/versioning on refresh? ‚Üí A: Keep last 3 versions per asset

## User Scenarios *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a dashboard owner, I want each site managed by the dashboard to have a recognizable logo, favicon, and a small media set (videos/images) so that end users see consistent branding and visual previews across the dashboard.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a site without assets, **When** assets are requested for that site, **Then** the system provides a logo and favicon and at least one image preview.
2. **Given** a site with existing assets, **When** assets are refreshed, **Then** updated logo, favicon, and preview media are available and correctly associated with the site.
3. **Given** a site, **When** viewing it in the dashboard list and detail, **Then** the logo and favicon display alongside at least one image or video preview.
4. **Given** an invalid site reference, **When** assets are requested, **Then** the system indicates no assets are available and suggests corrective action.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a site‚Äôs domain or branding changes? The system should allow assets to be updated without breaking references.
- How does the system handle missing or corrupted media files? It should fall back to placeholders and report the issue for remediation.
- How are overly large files handled? The system should enforce size limits and compress when necessary.
- How to handle sites that require authentication? The system should record that assets may be limited and mark them accordingly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a logo asset for each managed site.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a favicon asset for each managed site.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide at least one visual preview (image or video) for each managed site.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST associate each asset set with its site and present them in dashboard list and detail views.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow asset refresh/update for a site without disrupting existing links.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST indicate when assets are missing and show a branded placeholder.
 - **FR-007**: The system MUST enforce basic constraints (dimensions, size limits) and accepted formats per type: Logo (SVG), Favicon (ICO and PNG), Images (WebP), Video (MP4).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST record whether a site requires authentication that may limit asset capture or display.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST ensure consistent naming/metadata so assets can be organized and retrieved per site.
-.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST use a hybrid sourcing model: manual upload is the primary source; automated capture (e.g., via site metadata/content) is used only as a fallback when specific assets are missing.
 - **FR-011**: The system MUST provide exactly one preview image per site by default.
 - **FR-012**: The system MUST refresh assets only via manual trigger (no automated schedule).
 - **FR-013**: The system MUST retain the last 3 versions per asset upon refresh and remove older versions.
 - **FR-014**: The system MUST restrict generated and captured media to internal use only and prevent external redistribution; record license metadata for each asset.

*Ambiguities to clarify:*
  
 - **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]**: Exact dimension targets and maximum file sizes per asset type.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Site**: Represents a managed website; attributes include identifier, name, URL, requiresAuth flag.
- **SiteAssets**: Represents the asset set for a site; attributes include logo, favicon, previews (images/videos), updatedAt, notes, sourcingStrategy ("hybrid" with manual preferred and automated fallback), per-asset provenance flags (e.g., logoSource: manual|automated, faviconSource: manual|automated), and per-asset format metadata (e.g., mimeType, width/height when applicable, byteSize).
